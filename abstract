The aim of seismic exploration is to estimate the elastic parameters or rock properties quantitively
with the recording data on the surface. With the developement of 
high-performance computation ability and the
maturation of wide-azimuth, long-offset and broadband data accquisition 
technology, full waveform inversion (FWI) becomes a powerful tool to recover the full
wavenumber spectrum of the subsurface. However, FWI can not provide the perfectly estimated model
once and for all due to the obstacles such as bad initial models,
insufficiency of low frequency component in the data, inaccurately estimated source
wavelet, low sigal/noisy ratio in the data and so on,
In order to rebuild the model with different wavenumber spectrum, elastic full waveform inversion (EFWI), elastic wave equation 
reflected traveltime inversion (E-WERTI) and elastic least square reverse time
migration (E-LSRTM) are implemented with the help of wave mode decomposition, in which we
try to recover the full wavenumber, the low and intermediat wavenumber
and the high wavenumber spectrum of the elastic model, respectively.

Elastic reflection waveform inversion (ERWI) utilize the reflections to update the low and intermediate wavenumber in the
deeper part of model, which can provide good initial models for EFWI. However, ERWI suffers from
the cycle-skipping problem because of the objective function fitting waveform. Since taveltime
information relates to the background model more linearly, the cycle-skipping will be less severe
compared with waveform norm. Thus, in the third chapter we use the $L_2$ norm of the traveltime
residual extracted by the Dynamic image warping (DIW) as objective function in the manner of
WERTI. 
A two-step inversion strategy is adopted. Firstly, PP reflections are used to invert $V_p$. 
After that PS reflections are used to invert $V_s$ based on the well recoverd $V_p$. Surface P/S
separation and spatial wave mode decomposition provide P or S wave data effectively, which helps
to  reduce the nonlinearty of inversion greatly.
The kernel of reflection wavepath proves that mode decomposition can surpress the artifacts in
the reflection inversion. The local dip-dependent smooth filter ensures the inversion converging to a
geological model. Finally, numerical example of Sigsbee2A model validates the effectivenss of the 
algorithms and strategies for E-WERTI, whose results also are tested through EFWI.

E-LSRTM is the linearied EFWI aimming to fit the waveform of reflections with the inverted
high-wavenumber perturbations. Due to the energy difference between Born and reflection data, it is
more suitable to match the residual between reflection data and the background data during E-LSRTM. Conventional
E-LSRTM can sligthly mitigate the parameter trade-offs through iterations. While mode decomposition
isolates the S-wave part in  gradient calculation, which makes the inversion of S-wave velocity
perturbation a mono-parameter inversion to help mitigate the trade-offs. In the fourth chapter, we
design different inversion strategies to cope with the different situations. When $V_p$ is little
affected by $V_s$, we invert the two parameter simultaneously with mode decomposition; when $V_p$ and $V_s$ couple with each
other severely, we recommand inverting $V_s$ firstly followed by $V_p$ inversion to further mitigate
the trade-offs from $V_s$ during the $V_p$ inversion.
 
In this paper, we focus on the mode-decomposition-based inversion methods, select different strategy
according to the requirement of different inversion stage to reduce the nonlinearty, trade-off
effects and other problems and finally rebuild the elastic model from shallow to
deep.more accurately.
